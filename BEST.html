        can possibly have. Let's take a look at what those qualities are.

    <h2>Qualities of a GOD:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>They are a God..whatelse is there to say about them?!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>if you are looking for an image, let me tell you, you already know who that God is in your friends list! So, there is no
    need for an image.</p>
    <h2>Summary:</h2>
    <p>By now you should have an idea of what type of friends exist in your group. If you have a god in your group,
        feel blessed. If you have a Good friend in your group, feel lucky. And you can ignore the other two types.
